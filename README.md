# Focal Plane Calculations

The current repo aims to be a design tool for multiplex modular telescopes.
It produces 2 main information:

1. Coverage: fraction of the vignetting area covered by the summed up workspaces of all the robots
2. Positions: 3D positions (x,y,z, $\theta$, $\phi$) of robots & modules within the focal plane

# Results examples

Typical resulting files can be found in *Results_examples* folde
