# SolidworksAutomationTool

# Brief

The Solidworks Automation Tool project aims to automate complex and repetitive modelling tasks. 

Though there are parameter-based CAD software available, we chose to try automating Solidworks, as it is one of the most widely used CAD modelling software. 

The original idea was to have Python talking to Solidworks and give modelling commands. However, as of July 2023, Solidworks does not officially support Python. Instead, Solidworks has official APIs for C#, VBA, and C++.

We chose C# because of its high performance, high-level syntax and built-in garbage collector.
